    "Alex Holloway is an investigative journalist, known for in-depth features that combine cultural analysis with data storytelling. They work with both independent media outlets and major publishers, seeking to explore how society processes uncertainty — from political unrest to media myths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex is planning to write an article on how Global Stress Events impact the number of UFO sightings, and has asked us to conduct our analysis, using the publicly available NUFORC (National UFO Reporting Centre) UFO Sightings dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings/data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, Alex is looking for us to produce a public-facing, data-driven dashboard designed to act as a reference point for their article.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores the potential relationship between reported UFO sightings and global stress events, not to investigate extraterrestrial phenomena, but to examine whether these sightings reflect underlying patterns of public anxiety, media influence, and cultural tension."
